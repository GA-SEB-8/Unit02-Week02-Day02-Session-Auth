## About

Welcome to our module on session authentication in Express applications. This module is designed to equip you with the essential skills to build a secure and effective authentication system. By the end, you will have a foundational understanding of session-based authentication and a functional authentication template to use in your future projects.

This module covers critical areas including secure password storage, route protection for user-specific access, and the creation of custom middleware. This module is suitable for intermediate level developers with a foundational understanding of Express servers and RESTful routing practices.
